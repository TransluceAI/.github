# Open & Scalable Technology for Understanding AI Systems

Follow for updates, including the upcoming release of code described [here](https://transluce.org/releasing-ai-tools): an open-source LLM for producing automatic descriptions of features inside any model, and code for running your own endpoint of our [observability interface](https://monitor.transluce.org/dashboard/chat).

We actively value open-source contributors and encourage you to experiment with our tech! If youâ€™re interested in becoming an early tester, please [get in touch](mailto:info@transluce.org).
